### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the customer survey data to answer key questions such as:

- What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?

- What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?

- Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?

- If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?
